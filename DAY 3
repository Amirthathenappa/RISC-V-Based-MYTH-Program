DAY 3
https://github.com/stevehoover/RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop

*Logic gates - fundamental building blocs of digital circuits
*we have Boolean Arithmetic, Boolean Calc , verilog etc.. depending on the type the representation of the digital logic will change
this can be seen in fig 3

*implementation of a multiplexer
assign f=s?x1:x2;
*chaining ternary operators fig 4

*type "makerchip" in the browser , go into makerchip.com and launch an IDE
*in the IDE from the top slect the tutorials and there we can see various designs 
*and now we are going to choose FPGA Multiplier

LAB- For combinational Logic
step 1: open makerchip
step 2:click IDE
step 3: open tutorials , validity tutorial 
step 4: in tutorial , click "load pythagorean Example"

LAB- Making an inverter
step 1: open "examples" under tutorial
step 2:Load "Makerchip default template"
step 3:in line 16 , instead of // ,type "$out = ! $in1 ;" note the space are very important 
note we need not declare $out and $in like in verilog 
output of the above code is shown in fig5 of the document
step 4: to compile press "E Menu"

LAB-Operating on vectors
* $out[4:0] creates a "vector" of 5 bits
*trying out 
$out[4:0] = $in1[3:0] + $in2[3:0];
result in fig 6

*Multiplexer in fig 7

*combinational calculator
