DAY 3
https://github.com/stevehoover/RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop

*Logic gates - fundamental building blocs of digital circuits
*we have Boolean Arithmetic, Boolean Calc , verilog etc.. depending on the type the representation of the digital logic will change
this can be seen in fig 3

*implementation of a multiplexer
assign f=s?x1:x2;
*chaining ternary operators fig 4

*type "makerchip" in the browser , go into makerchip.com and launch an IDE
*in the IDE from the top slect the tutorials and there we can see various designs 
*and now we are going to choose FPGA Multiplier

LAB- For combinational Logic
step 1: open makerchip
step 2:click IDE
step 3: open tutorials , validity tutorial 
step 4: in tutorial , click "load pythagorean Example"
